# Network Security Scanner

This is a project which I have done in VCET HACKATHON. It was my problem statement which stated following things:
1. Scan automatically after sepcific time interval (In short a scheduler for some tasks).
2. Identify open ports.
3. Identify unnecessary services and eliminate if not required.
4. And any other network mapping or serurity feature which we can add

<hr>
So I have made an python application which can scan your internet ip to identify open ports. It will also scan your network network to identify active devices with their ip addresses. You can also check those active ip's open ports and check which service they are running. You can also schedule port scan on target ip. The application have a service tab which will show you a list of all the services running on your device and you can kill those services also from the application if its a service unknown to you.  
It was a project which I made to get into networking side of the IT field and got to learn a lot about how devices communicate over the internet and how services run on a machine.
